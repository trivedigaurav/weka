Weka 
=====

This is a fork of [bnjmn/weka](https://github.com/bnjmn/weka). We created this fork to add some additional functions needed to retrieve the feature weights from the LibSVM library when running linear regression.

> Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
> The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from
> your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing,
> classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.
> It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.

The official WEKA source code is hosted using subversion at the [Waikato SVN
